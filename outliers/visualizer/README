* Visualizer for identifying potential outliers in species distributions

If you want to use it with your own data then you'll have to generate a js file similar to the ones in the data directory.
The variables in the data files are:
- tname: name of the species
- coord: coordinates of the species presences
- bathy_stats: boxplot stats for the bathymetry
- bathy_out: boxplot outliers for the bathymetry
- bathy_which: 1 based indexes of the outliers in the coordinates array
- sss_stats: see bathy_stats
- sss_out: see bathy_out
- sss_which: see bathy_which
- sst_stats: see bathy_stats
- sst_out: see bathy_out
- sst_which: see bathy_which
- pcout: continuous output from pcout
